Web appendix accompanying the paper:

  Completeness and Decidability of Converse PDL 
     in the Constructive Type Theory of Coq

To build the theory files you need:

   mathcomp-1.6.4
   coq-8.7 (coq-8.6 and mathcomp-1.6.1 should work as well)

To build the HTML documentation run "make website". The entry points
to the two developments will then be gernerated in

   website/[C]PDL/toc.html
