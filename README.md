Theory files accompanying the paper:

  Completeness and Decidability of Converse PDL 
     in the Constructive Type Theory of Coq

To build the theory files you need:

   mathcomp-1.6.4 or mathcomp-1.7.0
   coq-8.9 (coq-8.8 or coq-8.7 should work as well)

To build the HTML documentation run "make html". The entry points
to the two developments will then be generated in

   html/toc.html

The documentation can also be browsed online at:
